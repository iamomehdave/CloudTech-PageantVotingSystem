            FACE OF CloudTech BEAUTY PAGEANT is an annual event where we bring together young, elegant, and intelligent girls between the ages of 18 to 30 years to compete for a chance to become the ‘FACE’ of Topflyers magazine. We believe this event affords an opportunity to naturally gifted females, to become famous and carve a niche for themselves in the world of beauty pageants. Notably, this is our 6th edition of FACE OF CloudTech BEAUTY PAGEANT, a pageant in a unique class of its own and attached to a brand magazine-name called (CloudTech Magazine).  <br>
